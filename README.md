[CellAtlasSearch: A Human single cell RNA-Seq Search Engine](http://cellatlassearch.iiitd.edu.in/cellatlassearch/index.php)

An explosion in production of single-cell expression data has triggered the need for a search engine. CellAtlasSearch uses GPU computing and Big Data mining techniques to address this need in a scalable manner. Users can query with one or multiple single-cell expression profiles to retrieve the top matches from a large database of the single cell and bulk expression profiles along with relevant meta-information.
